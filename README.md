3-DAY EXECUTION PLAN (REALISTIC)
🔵 DAY 1 — CORE AUTH (MANDATORY)

You must finish these or nothing else matters.

Registration ✅

Login (email + password)

JWT (access + refresh)

Profile update (name, username, pic)

Redis setup

Celery setup

👉 At end of Day 1:
User can register, login, get JWT, update profile

🔵 DAY 2 — VERIFICATION & SECURITY

Async-heavy day.

Email verification (SES + Celery)

Forgot password

Reset password

Phone OTP (Twilio + Redis)

Rate limiting (basic)

👉 At end of Day 2:
Account verification & recovery complete

🔵 DAY 3 — SOCIAL + HARDENING

Only if Day 1 & 2 are DONE.

Google authentication

Token refresh endpoint

Logout (optional)

Cleanup

README + API docs

If you start Google auth earlier → mistake.
